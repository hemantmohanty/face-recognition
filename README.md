# face-recognition
 A Python project for collecting face data and recognizing individuals by their names. The system captures face images, stores them in a dataset, and later uses that dataset for real-time face recognition. Built using OpenCV and face_recognition, it can be extended for use cases like attendance systems and identity verification.
